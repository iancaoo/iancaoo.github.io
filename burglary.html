            <p class="lead">There are several steps you can take to deter criminals from burglarizing your home. Secure the outside of your home by installing lighting, keeping trees and shrubs trimmed, and by prominently displaying a home alarm system decal. To secure the inside of your home, keep doors and windows locked at all times, install an alarm system, and cover your windows with curtains. To protect your home while you are on vacation, install timers on your lights, have a trusted neighbor pick up your mail, and let your neighbors know you will be out of town.</p>

              98% of shooters act alone. If you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire, you are usually safe.</p>

These tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you, and using a weapon with a low rate of fire. Getting away fast is usually the better option.
              <br>The one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter, in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit. In this case, running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance.</p>

              <p class="lead">Lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter. Remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up, and they're not interested in taking the path of most resistance. Lock the door, place a doorstop on it, and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter.
              <br>If the shooter is approaching, get away from the door as soon as you can. Stay away from all doors and windows.
              <br>If the door opens to the outside, a barricade will only delay the shooter for a moment. Building one may not be worth wasting time and blocking a potential escape route.
              <br>If you're in a bathroom that doesn't lock, loop a belt or T-shirt around the arms of the door butler (the metal hinge on top of the door that allows it to open).</p>

              <br>Use a landline instead of your cell phone if possible, so the police can automatically trace the call.
              <br>If you can't reach an emergency service, look for a ceiling sprinkler system and try to set it off by holding a lighter underneath the detector. This should automatically call the fire department.</p>

It can be a stapler or sharp scissors you find on the teacher's desk, the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office, beakers or dangerous acids (such as sulphuric) in a science room, or anything that is sharp, heavy, made of glass, or which can be used as a weapon. Hold on to these weapons if the shooter enters the room where you are.
              <br>Even small thrown objects can delay a gunman if a large group of people work together. While this is obviously a last resort, anyone who can't find a weapon should grab something to throw.[6]</p>

Brick or concrete walls, steel building support beams, or thick trees are the most common examples.[7] If you are trapped in a single room, your best option is a thick piece of furniture such as a heavy desk or filing cabinet.
              <br>Ideally, find a spot that does not restrict your movement. If the situation changes, you want to be able to run to an exit as fast as possible.</p>
