              <br>Don't rule out second story windows, or windows that you would have to break. You can survive cuts from broken glass, or a broken leg from a fall.
              98% of shooters act alone. If you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire, you are usually safe.</p>

These tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you, and using a weapon with a low rate of fire. Getting away fast is usually the better option.
              <br>The one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter, in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit. In this case, running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance.</p>

If you're running in a bigger group, it'll be harder to target you individually, and you'll have strength in numbers if you do run up against the shooter.</p>

              <br>Hiding is the second option because it traps you in one area. However, most mass shooting events are over within ten or fifteen minutes. If you can avoid the shooter for that long, you have a good chance at surviving.[4]</p>

              <p class="lead">Lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter. Remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up, and they're not interested in taking the path of most resistance. Lock the door, place a doorstop on it, and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter.
              <br>If the shooter is approaching, get away from the door as soon as you can. Stay away from all doors and windows.
              <br>If the door opens to the outside, a barricade will only delay the shooter for a moment. Building one may not be worth wasting time and blocking a potential escape route.
              <br>If you're in a bathroom that doesn't lock, loop a belt or T-shirt around the arms of the door butler (the metal hinge on top of the door that allows it to open).</p>

              <p class="lead">A mass shooting typically continues for five minutes before anyone calls the police. If you have other people in the room to barricade the door, calling immediately can be a big help. Once they've been called, law enforcement typically arrives within three minutes.[5]
              <br>Use a landline instead of your cell phone if possible, so the police can automatically trace the call.
              <br>If you can't reach an emergency service, look for a ceiling sprinkler system and try to set it off by holding a lighter underneath the detector. This should automatically call the fire department.</p>

              <p class="lead">Look around the room where you're hiding and find anything that you can use as a weapon. It can be a stapler or sharp scissors you find on the teacher's desk, the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office, beakers or dangerous acids (such as sulphuric) in a science room, or anything that is sharp, heavy, made of glass, or which can be used as a weapon. Hold on to these weapons if the shooter enters the room where you are.
              <br>Even small thrown objects can delay a gunman if a large group of people work together. While this is obviously a last resort, anyone who can't find a weapon should grab something to throw.[6]</p>

              <p class="lead">The term cover refers to barriers that will stop a bullet. Brick or concrete walls, steel building support beams, or thick trees are the most common examples.[7] If you are trapped in a single room, your best option is a thick piece of furniture such as a heavy desk or filing cabinet.
              <br>Ideally, find a spot that does not restrict your movement. If the situation changes, you want to be able to run to an exit as fast as possible.</p>

              <p class="lead">People have survived mass shootings by playing dead in areas where shots have been fired.[8] However, some shooters are aware of this tactic and will target bodies.[9] The only time you should try this is when both running and hiding are impossible.</p>

              <p class="lead">If you are in a group of people and cannot avoid the shooter, your best chance is to create as much noise and movement as possible. Shouting, throwing objects, and running will buy you a few extra seconds to leave the room, or to attack the shooter if there is no escape route.</p>

              <p class="lead">Use scissors, glass, or any other sharp or heavy objects to attack the shooter as soon as you are in close proximity. Even a sharp ballpoint pen is better than nothing. You're fighting for your life and every second counts.
              <br>Once again, this is an absolute last resort. Most shooters are heavily armed, and some wear body armor. Even if you have a gun of your own, you are most likely at a disadvantage.</p>

              <p class="lead">Try to hurt the shooter in the face, eyes, shoulders, or neck, or arms, so that they are more likely to let go of their weapon. You should stab them in the neck, gouge out their eyes, or stab them in the arm -- doing anything you can to make them get rid of the weapon or to hurt them so the weapon is within your reach.
              <br>Kick him in the crotch (if they are a man) If you can't, go for their face or weapon. This will be an effective way to disarm him and to cause him a large amount of pain.</p>
